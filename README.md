Module 6 Challenge: Weather App

I created this project to work on API calls as well as local storage and js function practice.  This uses OpenWeather One Call API to pull in lat and long for a city and then another call for the weather for that city.  

Things I learned from this project:

I learned how to utilize DOM traversal much better with this project.  

I learned how to make calls/fetches from an API and how I need an API key to do so.  I then can substitute that key by making it a variable and using template literals to call it.  

I worked on putting lots of functions inside of functions so that it would have access to the data that the function already had.  This was a bit confusing to me at first and still need more practice on this.  

Some challenges I still had were getting my local storage to not show the same city twice.  If I search chicago two times, it'll create two buttons for that city in the recent search part.  I also was struggling getting those buttons to then re-search the city.
